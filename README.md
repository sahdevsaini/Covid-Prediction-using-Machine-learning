# Covid Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of Covid-19 infection based on various features. The goal is to create a reliable and accurate predictive model that can assist in early detection and management of the disease.

### Project Name
Covid Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Description
Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Early detection of the disease is crucial for effective treatment and controlling the spread of the virus. This project aims to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to classify individuals as Covid-positive or Covid-negative based on relevant features from the dataset.

### Project Phases
1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant medical data containing features related to Covid-19 infection.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform raw data into meaningful features suitable for model training.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize data to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among variables.
5. **Model Selection**: Evaluate various machine learning algorithms for classification.
6. **Model Building**: Develop and train models using selected algorithms.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
8. **Deployment**: Integrate the model into a deployable application or service for practical use.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of various features that may indicate a Covid-19 infection. These features include symptoms, demographic information, and medical history.
